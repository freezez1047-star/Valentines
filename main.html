                <p> Happy Valentines Day My pretty girl! You made me the happiest person in this world</p>

                <p> It still seems very unreal that this gorgeous and ethereal woman would still wanna be my valentine. You are the most beautiful and stunning woman in this world (not like i looked at any other girl) and i feel so blessed to have you in my life. You keep getting prettier day by the day and every day i keep falling in love with you more and more. You truly have me wrapped around your finger and i raelly wouldnt mind it- cuz like you are just so beautiful.</p>

                <p> Everything about you is just so beautiful Samhi. Your eyes are so magnetic, i can never stop drowning in your eyes. The way the brown turns to gold when they get illuminated by the sun, so gorgeous. Your smile, feels like a warm winter morning. Seeing you smile warms my heart and brings peace and happiness to my soul. Makes me wanna do stuff that you love and makes you happy more and more. Need i say more about your voice? I can go on listening to you for hours and hours long and i would still wanna heart more from you, your voice is just so harmonious and sweet, sweeter than sugar i must say. I cant go a single day without hearing you or seeing you Samhi. </p>

                <p> I am completely smitten by you and i am irrevocably in love with you my love. Every day with you is a test of courage and a reminder on why i love you, Cant go a single day without being a bratty ahhh kid can you? Good lord you keep me on my toes on a daily basis. Either way, You are the still the person i wanna marry and be with for the rest of my life..</p>

                <p> Thanks for being my valentine this year and i hope that i get to be your valentine every year. Just dont die please, stay alive otherwise ill have no one to celebrate valentines day with. </p>
